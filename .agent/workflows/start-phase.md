# Start Phase Workflow

## Steps

1. **Identify current phase** from `docs/03-implementation-plan.md`

3. **Create phase tracking:**
   - Mark phase as in-progress in task list
   - Note start date

4. **Execute phase tasks:**
   - Work through each task in the phase table
   - Create files following project structure rules
   - Apply NativeWind styling rules
   - Follow Supabase patterns for database work

5. **Verify exit criteria:**
   - Run through all exit criteria checkboxes
   - Test functionality as described
   - Take screenshots if UI changes

6. **Complete phase:**
   - Mark phase complete in task list
   - Create walkthrough documenting changes
   - Commit code with phase reference
